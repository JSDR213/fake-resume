## Overview
Grumpy cat is looking for a new job and needs a resume! Using what you know about HTML, help him by creating a resume website for him. (Note: You don't need to know 'real information' about Grumpy Cat -- just make things up!)

## Getting Started
- `Fork` and `clone` this repository
- `cd` into the directory on your local machine
- Create an `index.html`file 


This is what he wants you to include and do for his resume:

- have an `index.html` file

- have HTML `boilerplate` code for `index.html`
  - _HINT:_ in your `index.html` file type `html` or `!` and press tab. A few basic HTML tags should populate your file, including `head` and `body`
- Include:
  - at least one header
  - navigation (these can be dummy links that don't go anywhere yet)
  - at least one list




## Adding Content
1. Insert a professional image of Grumpy Cat ('img' tag), it should be placed right after your 'h1' tags
1. Insert an unordered list of his past three work positions ('ul' tag)
1. Create links for LinkedIn and Facebook/Twitter pages ('a' tag). You can set this to a dummy link
1. Use level-three heading tags to create headings before the work positions and before the links

:red_circle: **Commit your work!** <br>
Your commit message should read something like: <br>
"added initial content for resume site"
